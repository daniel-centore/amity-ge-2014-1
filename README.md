# Amity GE Project 2014: Tetris

Amity Regional High School's 2014 submission for the GE Computer Science competition case study.

The goal was to build an AI which would play the classic video game Tetris.

This submission won 1st place. It never actually lost a game and continually played Tetris from the submission time until grading time.

The AI was based on a Genetic Algorithm which was used to develop an excellent heuristic about the ideal location for the next piece.
